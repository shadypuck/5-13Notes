    \item We'll begin with Topic A: Introduction.
    \item \textbf{Radical}: A neutral, carbon-centered (for the sake of this class) species that can be characterized by electron spin resonance (ESR).

        \caption{A radical.}
        \label{fig:rad}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ESR is also beyond the scope of this class; it is analogous to NMR if you are curious.
        \item Reading: Chapter 37 of \textcite{bib:Clayden}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Structure of radicals.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.1\linewidth]{radStructure.png}
        \caption{Radical structure.}
        \label{fig:radStructure}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The carbon center is $sp^2$-hybridized.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is approximately planar (aka a "shallow pyramid," but we don't have to worry about that).
            \item It is subject to stereochemical "umbrella-ing": When $sp^3$-hybridized, radicals rapidly invert, like an umbrella in a windstorm.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Thus, for our purposes, there are no enantiomerically enriched radicals.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Aside: It is a trend in modern research to take things that are unstable and stabilize them, e.g., via binding to a transition metal.
            \item People are designing molecules that can selectively bond to one face of a radical over another.
            \item All of this is way beyond the scope of this class.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Stability of radicals.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Radicals are electron-deficient, so methods of donating electron density into the partially filled orbital are typically the most useful at stabilizing them.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Hyperconjugative stabilization.
    \begin{equation*}
        3^\circ > 2^\circ > 1^\circ > \ce{Me}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It's about a \kcal{3} difference between $3^\circ$ and $2^\circ$, and between $2^\circ$ and $1^\circ$.
        \item However, it's about a \kcal{6} difference between $1^\circ$ and methyl.
        \item These differences roughly correlate with the number of hyperconjugative, no-bond resonance structures.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 9 such structures for $3^\circ$, 6 for $2^\circ$, 3 for $1^\circ$, and 0 for methyl.
            \item Analogously to Figure \ref{fig:hyperconjugationCCa}, each methyl group adjacent to the radical adds three \ce{C-H} bonds that can donate into the partially filled radical $p$-orbital.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Heteroatom destabilization.
    \begin{equation*}
        \ce{R3C*} > \ce{R2N*} > \ce{RO*}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Note that since radicals are electron deficient, carbon-centered radicals are also more stable than radicals centered on more electronegative elements.
    \end{itemize}
    \pagebreak
    \item Resonance stabilization.

    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Allyl (Figure \ref{fig:radResa}) and benzyl (Figure \ref{fig:radResb}) radicals are also significantly stabilized, due to resonance.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The allyl radical is \kcal{9} more stable than the propyl radical; \kcal{9} amounts to hundreds of times increased stability since each \kcal{1.4} is a 10-fold increase in stability.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Unlike many other electron-deficient species, electron-withdrawing groups actually stabilize radicals as well (Figures \ref{fig:radResc} \& \ref{fig:radResd})!
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is because of resonance.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Lastly, radicals are also stabilized by lone pairs.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This yields 2-centered, 3-electron bonding.
            \item Implication: Radicals $\alpha$ to an ether are stabilized. Here's why this is important.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item When you work in the lab (at MIT or elsewhere) and you buy an ether, the two most common ones to buy are tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether (\ce{Et2O}).
                \item Once you open the container, you need to date it and then check it every six months for peroxides. These can form spontaneously in air, and then are dangerous because they're explosive!
            \end{itemize}
            \item An analogy to this is the stabilization of carbocations by resonance (see Figure \ref{fig:CCheteroatoma}).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Unstable radicals.

        \label{fig:radUnstable}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What these all have in common is that they must be generated by cleaving (in a homolytic sense) relatively strong \ce{C-H} bonds.
        \item In contrast, many of the radicals in Figure \ref{fig:radRes} derive from relative weaker \ce{C-H} bonds (in a homolytic sense).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Generation of radicals.
    \item Peroxides.

    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Many old acne medications contained benzoyl peroxide.
        \item The center \ce{O-O} bond is very weak: It's bond dissociation energy is only about \kcal{30}.
        \item Thus, under heat or light, the \ce{O-O} bond can break in two (we draw this using \emph{single-headed} curved arrows) to yield an intermediate.
        \item This intermediate will then either quickly do decarboxylation to form \ce{CO2} and a phenyl radical, or quickly grab hydrogen from a nearby \ce{R-H} to form benzoic acid and a \ce{R*} radical.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Either process kills the bacteria in acne!
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Initiators.

    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AIBN (azoisobutyronitrile) --- under light or heat --- forms nitrogen gas and two equivalents of a tertiary, resonance-stabilized radical (see Figure \ref{fig:radResd}).
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now move onto Topic B: Reactions of radicals.
    \item Radicals often participate in \textbf{radical chain reactions}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These are used in the synthesis of polymers, they're in our body, and we put things in our food to prevent them because food spoils via radical chain reactions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now discuss Topic B.1: Termination steps.
    \item \textbf{Termination} (step): A process that consumes radicals via mutual annihilation.
    \item We'll now cover Topic B.1.a{}: Radical-radical coupling.

    \item We now move onto Topic B.1.b{}: Disproportionation.

    \end{figure}
    \item We now move onto Topic B.2: Propagation steps.
    \item More specifically, we'll cover Topic B.2.a{}: Abstraction.

        \caption{Radical abstraction.}
        \label{fig:radAbstract}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Also called S\textsubscript{H}2 (substitution, homolytic, bimolecular).
        \item This step continues the radical chain because we put one radical in and get one radical out.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now move onto Topic B.2.b{}: Addition to double and triple bonds.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.33\linewidth]{radAddMult.png}
        \caption{Radical addition to multiple bonds.}
        \label{fig:radAddMult}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We attack an \ce{X=Y} bond, attach to one atom (say \ce{X}), and form a \ce{Y}-centered radical.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now move onto Topic B.2.c{}: Fragmentation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is typified by the decarboxylation reaction in Figure \ref{fig:radGenPeroxide}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item We now move onto Topic B.2.d{}: Rearrangement.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.24\linewidth]{radRearr.png}
        \caption{Radical rearrangement.}
        \label{fig:radRearr}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This allows us to get to a more stable radical, e.g., $1^\circ\to 3^\circ$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Radical fragmentation and rearrangement, in particular, are usually \emph{very fast} processes.
    \item We now move onto Topic B.3: Radical chain reactions.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These have three steps: Initiation, propagation, and termination.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Example radical chain reaction: Radical reduction.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Combine \ce{R-Br} and \ce{Bu3Sn-H} with a catalytic amount of AIBN at \SI{80}{\celsius}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Every butyl group is \emph{n}-butyl, but Prof. Buchwald won't write out all the n's.
        \end{itemize}
        \item This reduces the alkyl halide to an alkyl group!
        \item Energetic analysis.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bond dissociation energies (BDEs).
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The \ce{R-Br} bond has a BDE of about \kcal{70}.
                \item The \ce{Bu3Sn-H} bond has a BDE of about \kcal{74}.
                \item The \ce{R-H} bond in the product has a BDE of about \kcal{95}.
                \item The \ce{Bu3Sn-Br} bond in the product has a BDE of about \kcal{85}.
            \end{itemize}
            \pagebreak
            \item Thus, via Hess's law, this reaction is thermodynamically favorable overall by \kcal{36}!
        \end{itemize}
        \item However, if we just mix the reactants, nothing happens because of the \emph{kinetic} barrier.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is why we add a catalytic amount of AIBN.
            \item Note that we do mean "catalytic amount" and not "catalyst": AIBN is consumed in the reaction and not regenerated (per Figure \ref{fig:radGenAIBN}), so it is not technically a catlyst.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Let's now discuss the mechanism of the above reaction.

        \caption{Radical reduction mechanism.}
        \label{fig:radRXreduceMech}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First, AIBN will undergo its initiation reaction (see Figure \ref{fig:radGenAIBN}).
        \item The radicals generated by this initiation step go after the weak \ce{Bu3Sn-H} bond, generated a tributylstannyl (\ce{Bu3Sn*}) radical.
        \item These tin radicals then like to go after halogens because \ce{Sn-X} bonds are \emph{strong}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Thus, this step is favorable by about \kcal{15}!
        \end{itemize}
        \item Then the \ce{R*} radical can go after the next molecule of \ce{Bu3Sn-H} to regenerate \ce{Bu3Sn*} (to react further) as well as a molecule of the \ce{R-H} product.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This step is favorable by about \kcal{21}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Adding up the propagation steps both thermodynamically and molecule-by-molecule gives our net reaction and $\Delta H=-\kcal{36}$.
        \item Termination steps.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Radical-radical coupling (see Figure \ref{fig:radCoupling}) of \ce{Bu3Sn*} radicals, \ce{R*} radicals, and \ce{Bu3Sn* + R*}.
            \item For a radical chain process to be efficient, we want propagation to occur around a hundred times before termination occurs.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

        \item The final exam counts for $4/3$ the credit of a typical 1-hour exam.
        \item They made an exam that is 200 points, and they will then scale everyone's score down to 133.$\overline{3}$ points.
        \item The exam's difficulty parallels the previous exams and practice exams.
        \item It is comprehensive: You should remember the things you learned during the first half of the course.
        \item Some of today's material may appear on the final.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Lecture 38 recap.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Radicals: Neutral, often carbon-centered, seven electrons.
        \item Stabilization.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Order of stability: $3^\circ>2^\circ>1^\circ>\ce{Me}$.
            \item Can also be stabilized through resonance (e.g., allyl and benzyl radicals).
            \item Other stabilied radicals (Figure \ref{fig:radRes}).

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Radical processes like the one in Figure \ref{fig:radAbstractHa} can cause all kinds of spoilage and damage in food, so we add in butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item See the discussion below Figure \ref{fig:CCrearrFCalkyl} for more on BHT.
        \end{itemize}
        \item BHT can receive a reactive, damaging radical and form a stabilized, relatively unreactive radical (Figure \ref{fig:radAbstractHb}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This slows down the process of spoilage!
        \end{itemize}
        \item Besides BHT, Vitamin E is nature's radical scavenger (Figure \ref{fig:radAbstractHc}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item BHT is just a suped-up form of Vitamin E.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Radical additions.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item See Figure \ref{fig:radAddMult}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item You've also seen this in 5.12, but it's worth reviewing now.
        \end{itemize}
        \item You should remember hydrohalogenation reactions from 5.12 (Figure \ref{fig:radAdditiona}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It gives the Markovnikov product.
            \item This is because the secondary carbocation is far more stable than the primary carbocation.
        \end{itemize}
        \item However, if we do this reaction in diethyl ether (also known as just "ether") on a sunny day, we get the anti-Markovnikov product as well (Figure \ref{fig:radAdditionb})!
        \item Let's see how this happens (Figures \ref{fig:radAdditionc}-\ref{fig:radAdditione}).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Organic peroxides (formed in ether as discussed last class) react with light in an initiation step.
            \item Then propagation proceeds through a secondary radical that is more stable than a primary radical.
            \item Sometime down the line, we can annihilate our radicals in termination steps. For example, two bromine radicals could recomibine into \ce{Br2}.
        \end{itemize}

        \label{fig:radAllNBS}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In addition to \emph{N}-bromosuccinimide (NBS), \emph{N}-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) and \emph{N}-iodosuccinimide (NIS) are a thing!
        \item In an initiation step, we cleave the \ce{N-Br} bond to form a succinimidyl radical that is doubly stabilized by resonance with the two adjacent carbonyls, even though its nitrogen-centered.
        \item Then the bromine radical (\ce{Br*}) abstracts an allylic hydrogen.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It doesn't go after the vinyl or alkyl hydrogens because they don't have resonance stabilization, like the allylic positions do.
        \end{itemize}
        \item This gives \ce{HBr} as a byproduct.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \ce{HBr} then reacts with NBS to form a \emph{very small} amount of \ce{Br2}.
            \item It is important that only a very small amount of \ce{Br2} is formed, because we don't want \ce{Br2} to dibrominate the olefin (as you studied in 5.12).
        \end{itemize}
        \item The allylic radical now comes in and brominates itself using \ce{Br2}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This regenerates \ce{Br*}, and the propagation steps continue.
        \end{itemize}
        \item This mechanism is somewhat surprising to Prof. Buchwald, because it seems like the allylic radical could just react with NBS directly in a propagation step. However, it was proven that this is \emph{not} the case, and the drawn mechanism is correct.
    \end{itemize}
    \pagebreak
    \item How does \ce{HBr} react with NBS to form \ce{Br2} and succinimide?

        \label{fig:BrNBSHBr}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \ce{HBr} (a strong acid) protonates the NBS carbonyl, and then \ce{Br-} attacks the protonated NBS's \ce{Br} atom.
        \item Then we get an \textbf{amide-iminol tautomerization}.
        \item This is not content you have to worry about.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is similar to using Gilman's reagent for 1,4-addition (see Figure \ref{fig:14add})!
        \item The tributylstannyl radical is once again useful for abstracting bromine from an alkyl halide, and we generate it using \ce{AIBN + HSnBu3}.
        \item Note that the \ce{R*} radical is not too electron deficient.
        \item Additionally, the $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated system reacts more slowly with electron-deficient olefins.
        \item We preferentially form the more electron deficient radical that is in resonance with the EWG.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

        \item Now we've gone from a system with one ring to a system with two rings.

    \item Radical rearrangements.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item One common reactant is called a 5-hexenyl radical.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The rate of reaction is $k=\SI{e5}{\per\second}$, which is pretty fast!
            \item Note that formation of the top product proceeds 50 times faster than the formation of the bottom product.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Another common reactant is a cyclopropylmethyl radical.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The rate of reaction is $k=\SI{e8}{\per\second}$, which is \emph{extremely} fast!
            \item We're still forming a primary radical as a byproduct (which isn't super stable), but we're gifted \kcal{25} by the cyclopropane ring opening.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item 1,2-shifts of aryl groups.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item The driving force is going from a primary radical to a more stable tertiary radical.
        \item Once we form the unstable (because we've broken aromaticity) intermediate, it can either react backwards or proceed on to the product.
